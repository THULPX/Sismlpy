# Sismlpy
As a 2025 PhD student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, I hope to build a machine learning algorithm library "Sismlpy" in artificial intelligence for myself and my friends to learn and use.

I classified the 62 algorithms into ten modules according to the categories, and each algorithm has code and instructions.

The following is the directory of Sismlpy :
